# Simple-Lang

A very basic programming language made using YACC and Flex.

While self studying compiler design, each book mentioned these two tools, so I figured I should give them a shot.


## Tools
* [Flex](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/lex/index.html) - Fast lexical analyzer generator
* [YACC](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/index.html) - Yet Another Compiler-Compiler
