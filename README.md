# Simple-Lang

A stupidly basic programming language I started making using YACC and Lex.


While self studying compiler design, each book I referenced mentioned these two tools, 
so I figured I should screw around with them a bit at the very least.
They're cool and all, but I want to get into the guts of writing lexers and parsers by hand.
